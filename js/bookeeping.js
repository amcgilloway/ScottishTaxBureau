export const bookKeeping = "<p>Keeping business records is very important as these are the
								basis on which we prepare the finalised accounts. In the event
								of an enquiry, HMRC may request to see your paperwork to support
								the submitted accounts. <br /> We offer to process and file your
								paperwork in a timely and organised manner, so your records are
								kept up to date and easy to access. This also helps us in
								getting to know and understand your business better, and be able
								to provide the best service tailored to your needs. <br />

								Regular bookkeeping also means that your annual accounts can be
								finalised soon after the year end. <br /></p>"
