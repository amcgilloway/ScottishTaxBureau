For Employers – As part of our payroll service, we operate the
								PAYE scheme for your employees, advising you of the tax and
								national insurance deductions and net wage for each employee.
								The tax &amp; NI deductions must be reported and paid to HMRC on
								a monthly basis and we will advise you of the total amounts each
								payday. <br /> For Employees - PAYE is the method of paying
								income tax and National Insurance through your wages as an
								employee. <br /> HMRC notify your employer of the tax code to
								use in order to calculate the tax deductions. This tax code will
								depend on your own circumstances and can vary depending on
								factors such as previous years’ tax, or benefits you receive
								such as a company car, medical insurance etc. <br /> You may be
								able to claim relevant job expenses, depending on the nature of
								your work. We offer to submit a claim for this to HMRC on your
								behalf. <br />
