Workplace Pension schemes<br /> Automatic enrolment is a new law
								which means that every employer must automatically enrol
								employees into a workplace pension scheme if they meet certain
								criteria. <br /> Every employer has a different ‘staging date’,
								i.e. the date Automatic Enrolment begins, and we will work
								closely with you to ensure you meet the requirements of this new
								law. <br />
