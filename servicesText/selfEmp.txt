If you have started self-employment you must register with HM
								Revenue &amp; Customs. We will take the stress out of this by
								dealing with the registration process. <br /> Self-employed must
								complete tax returns and are liable to income tax and National
								Insurance on business profits. They may also have to register
								for VAT, depending on the level of turnover. <br /> We will
								prepare annual accounts which form the basis of the tax return,
								calculate any tax and National Insurance due, and submit your
								tax return to HMRC each year. <br />
