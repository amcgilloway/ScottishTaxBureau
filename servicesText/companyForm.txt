A popular option for running your own business is to set up as a
								limited company. There are many benefits to having a company,
								and we can assess if this would best suit you, depending on your
								own circumstances. <br /> We provide an incorporation service,
								dealing with the registration process at Companies House, and
								also offer company secretarial services including the annual
								filing with Companies House and receiving all official mail on
								your behalf, as the company’s registered office. <br />
