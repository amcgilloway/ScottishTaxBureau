Self-assessment is not simply for those who are self-employed.
								There are many circumstances in which you may be required to
								complete a self-assessment tax return, including the following:
								<br /> Rental Income -  You have to notify HMRC if you are renting
								out one or more properties, as any profits could be liable to
								tax and you may need to submit annual tax returns to declare
								this income. <br /> Non-Resident Landlords – you must still
								declare your rental income to HMRC and submit tax returns for
								rental income from your UK property<br /> Capital Gains - Any
								profit you make from selling an asset could be liable to capital
								gains tax.  We can assess if you have to pay capital gains tax and
								complete a tax return reporting the gain and relevant tax
								liability. <br /> Foreign Income - You may need to pay tax on
								foreign income such as wages from working abroad, rental income,
								foreign investments or savings interest. <br /> Dividends - From
								April 2016 new rules on the taxation of dividends were
								introduced. Any dividends over £5,000 will be liable to income
								tax and must be declared to HMRC. <br /> If you are unsure about
								whether you should be completing a tax return please contact us.<br />
