Whether self-employed or a limited company, we will prepare
								annual business accounts. For self-employed these generally run
								from 6 April – 5 April, while companies will have different year
								ends. <br /> For limited companies annual accounts must be
								submitted to both Companies House and HMRC. We aim to finalise
								accounts within a few months of your company year end, so that
								the information is up to date and filing deadlines are met. <br />

								The accounts can also be used as support if you are applying for
								a business loan, or entering a finance agreement. <br /> We also
								offer management account preparation, either on a monthly or
								quarterly basis, so you can assess your business performance
								throughout the year. <br />
