If your business is at the stage where you need to hire
								employees, we offer a payroll service to help you make the
								transition to becoming an employer. <br /><br /> Anyone can be an
								employer, whether self-employed or a limited company. We will
								register your business with HMRC as an employer and process your
								payroll on a regular basis, providing payslips (paper or by
								email), advising of your employees’ net wages, and any tax &amp;
								National Insurance deductions made under the PAYE scheme.<br /> <br />

								As part of the service we also process forms such as P45s and
								P60s, and calculate statutory payments including sick pay and
								maternity pay. <br /> <br />Real Time Information (RTI) <br /> <br />RTI was
								introduced by HMRC in the 2013/14 tax year and was a major
								change to the payroll legislation. <br /> <br />Employers must submit
								returns to HMRC on or before each payday, with details of
								starters, leavers, and tax &amp; NI deductions etc. <br /><br /> We
								will submit the returns with every pay-run to ensure you are
								compliant with this legislation. <br />
