If you are going into business with somebody else, you can set
								up a ‘partnership’. This can either be an ordinary, limited or a
								limited liability partnership. <br /> As with self-employment,
								each partner is liable to income tax and National Insurance, and
								must submit tax returns to HMRC. A tax return must also be
								submitted for the partnership itself. The partnership may also
								be liable for VAT depending on the turnover. <br /> We will
								prepare the annual accounts, submit the tax returns, and
								calculate the tax and NI liabilities. <br />
