If your business offers Machine Games (such as those found in
								pubs and clubs), you may be liable for Machine Games Duty which
								is a tax on machines which offer cash prizes. Tax is calculated
								on your net takings from the machine. <br /> We can discuss if
								this scheme applies to your business, and if so we will register
								you with HMRC, prepare and submit the quarterly returns and
								calculate any tax due. <br />
