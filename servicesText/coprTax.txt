Limited companies are liable to corporation tax, as opposed to
								income tax for individuals. This tax is calculated on the
								company profits. <br /> As part of the company formation
								process, HMRC are notified of the incorporation and issue the
								company with its own unique tax reference. A tax return must be
								completed which includes the corporation tax calculation. <br />

								We prepare and submit the company tax return along with the
								annual accounts, keeping your company compliant with HMRC
								regulations. <br />
