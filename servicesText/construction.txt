This scheme is a method of collecting money in advance towards
								the tax and National Insurance liabilities of subcontractors.
								The deduction is made by contractors and paid to HMRC. <br />

								For Contractors – If you hire subcontractors for construction
								work, you must register as a contractor with HMRC. Monthly
								returns must be submitted to HMRC reporting the payments and
								deductions for each subcontractor. We will register you as a
								contractor, and verify each subcontractor with HMRC, submit the
								monthly returns, and advise you of the net payments and tax
								deductions. <br /> For Subcontractors – At the end of each tax
								year, we will calculate any refund of the total CIS deductions
								made in that year, for both self-employed and limited companies.
								If a refund is due we will then make a claim with HMRC for this
								on your behalf. <br />
